<p>A newly created Alaska Open Data Portal has made the previous budgets available along with the proposed budget for 2019. Many Alaskan's have strong opinions on what and where to change the current budget but have not had the data available to them in a digital format until now.</p>
<p>Help with some of the terminology can be found on the <a href="https://www.omb.alaska.gov/html/informationreports/budget-terminology.html">Office of Managment and Budget</a> website</p>
