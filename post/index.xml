      <description>The gtfs and gtfs-realtime are the modern standards for sharing public transit scheduled data and current updates to routes. The embedded script will tell you what is currently publicly shared (transitfeeds.com) and what is currently being published to google.
As of the writing of this script, there are 96 different realtime feeds from a handful of agencies around the world that publish an updated, and available publicly.</description>

      <description>Using the script from an earlier post, (An overview of public transit feeds around the world)[http://akdata.org/2017/05/05/an-overview-of-public-transit-feeds-around-the-world/], I organized and cleaned up the public realtime feeds available at transitfeeds.com. The number I came up with in the earlier post for number of agency feeds is actually smaller! Many agencies have seperated their alert, positions, and trip update feeds. Wow, so it actually much smaller,
